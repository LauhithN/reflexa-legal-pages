        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Reflexy &mdash; Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Reflexy ("the App") is a reaction-time game developed by an independent developer. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your rights.</p>

        <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Reflexy does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information. Specifically, the App does not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs (IDFA)</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or telemetry</li>
            <li>Photos, camera, or microphone input</li>
            <li>Health, fitness, or biometric data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>The App stores the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong> to provide core functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game scores and results</strong> &mdash; your reaction times, tap counts, and game outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Player statistics</strong> &mdash; personal bests, total games played, daily streak count</li>
            <li><strong>Preferences</strong> &mdash; sound and haptics toggle settings</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase status</strong> &mdash; whether you have unlocked premium games</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to the developer or any third party.</p>

        <h2>Apple Services</h2>
        <p>Reflexy integrates with the following Apple services, which are governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Center</strong> &mdash; If you sign in to Game Center, your scores may be submitted to Apple's leaderboards and your achievements may be recorded. This data is managed by Apple, not by the developer.</li>
            <li><strong>In-App Purchases (StoreKit)</strong> &mdash; Purchase transactions are processed entirely by Apple. The developer does not receive or store any payment information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Reflexy does <strong>not</strong> use any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or data-collection services. There are no third-party SDKs embedded in the App.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Reflexy does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The App is safe for users of all ages.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>The App includes a share feature that lets you share your game results via the iOS share sheet. This is entirely user-initiated, and the developer has no access to shared content or its recipients.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
